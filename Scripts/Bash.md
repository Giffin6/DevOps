## ABOUT
Bash scripting refers to the process of creating and writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. However, Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, which is known as a script.In bash script, the first line`(#!/bin/bash)` is called a "shebang" and indicates that the script should be executed using Bash  

Bash scripts are used for a variety of purposes, such as:

- **Automation:** Bash scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks, allowing users to execute a series of commands or operations with a single script
- **System Administration:** System administrators use Bash scripts to automate various system maintenance tasks, configuration, and monitoring
- **Custom Tools:** Bash scripts can be used to create custom tools or utilities, tailored to specific needs
- **Data Processing:** Bash is handy for simple text processing tasks, making it useful for handling data files or logs
- **Shell Programming:** Bash is a shell, and scripting allows you to write more complex programs, incorporating conditional statements, loops, and functions

#### Difference between script and programming language
- **Script:**
  - **Interpreted:** Scripts are typically interpreted rather than compiled. This means that a script is executed line by line by an interpreter, which reads and executes the code directly
  - **Shorter Development Time:** Scripts are often used for tasks that don't require extensive optimization or compilation. They are generally quicker to write and can be more easily modified
  - **Focus on Automation and Gluing Tasks:** Scripts are often used for automating tasks or for gluing together existing programs or tools. They might not be as feature-rich or structured as full programming languages
  - **Examples:** Shell scripts, JavaScript running in a browser, Python and Ruby scripts
- **Programming Language:**
  - **Compiled or Interpreted:** Programming languages can be either compiled or interpreted. In compiled languages, the code is translated into machine code before execution, while interpreted languages are executed by an interpreter at runtime
  - **Support for Larger Software Projects:** Programming languages are designed to handle larger and more complex software projects. They offer features such as modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation, allowing for the development of large-scale applications
  - **Strong Typing:** Many programming languages have a strong typing system, which means that the data type of a variable is enforced more strictly. This can catch errors at compile-time
  - **Performance Optimization:** Programming languages often provide more opportunities for performance optimization through compilation and other techniques. They are used for developing software where speed and efficiency are critical
  - **Examples:** C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go
