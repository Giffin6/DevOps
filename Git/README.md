## Git
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, keeping track of their changes and managing the project's source code history. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become one of the most popular version control systems in the world.

Here are some key concepts and features of Git:
- **Distributed Version Control:** Unlike centralized version control systems (CVCS), Git is distributed, meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history. This decentralization enhances collaboration and allows developers to work offline.
